        Founded in 2017, Yubai is one of the first technology pioneers in Lebanon and Iraq. The company developed a platform that delivers high-quality convenience to customers (deliveries range from food, grocery, electronics, retail, and courier services) and currently collaborates with 4,000 partners, serving half a million customers in all of its markets. Customers on the platform also have access to <i>Yubai Fresh</i>, a chain of dark grocery warehouses that deliver within 15 minutes.
